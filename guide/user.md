add SAP_ALL & SAP_NEW in profile

- SAP_ALL: Assigns all authorizations in SAP NetWeaver AS to users. Use this profile with extreme care.

- SAP_NEW: Legacy. The SAP_NEW profile has been replaced with a generated role, SAP_NEW. The authorization object exists to bridge the differences in authorization checks between releases. SAP_NEW enables your business processes to continue functioning until you have incorporated the new authority checks in your authorization concept.
